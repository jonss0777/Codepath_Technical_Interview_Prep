Problem 3: Remove Duplicates

Write a function remove_dupes() that accepts a sorted array
items, and removes the duplicates in-place such that 
each element appears only once. Return the length of 
the modified array. You may not create another array;
your implementation must modify the original input array
items.


U:

Remove duplicates

cunren


P:
current plan requires O(n^2)
i move j to the end 
increase i move j to the end
if lst[i]== lst[j]

Note: the input is sorted

I:

for item in lst:
    if next item == current item:
